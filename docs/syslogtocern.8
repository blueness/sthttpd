.SH NAME
syslogtocern - convert thttpd syslog entries into CERN Common Log format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syslogtocern
.I logfile
.RI ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reads one or more syslog files as input.
Takes the thttpd entries, and converts them into CERN Combined Common
Log format.
Produces two files as output: access_log and error_log.
If files with those names already exist in the current directory, they
are overwritten.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
thttpd(8)
.SH "BUGS / DEFICIENCIES"
Lumps all thttpd processes together.
It ought to produce separate files for each, identified by IP address and
port number.
However, that change represents a huge increase in complexity, so next version.
